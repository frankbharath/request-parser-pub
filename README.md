# Request Parser

The document describes the purpose of developing a framework that validates incoming parameter requests.

## Problem
When I was working on my project, I had to make sure all the incoming request parameters are validated before providing them to corresponding service class. I was developing my project using Spring framework and spring does provide annotations to validate the request parameters. For example 

@RestController
@Validated
public class TestController {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@GetMapping("/student/")<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ResponseEntity<String> student(@RequestParam("age") @Min(5) int age) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return ResponseEntity.ok("Your age is " + age);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
}<br/>

The above student function expects the age value to be greater than or equal to 5 and throws exception if is less the 5. But what if there are multiple criteriaâ€™s such as minimum length, maximum length, required, pattern match? As my domain objects were complex, annotating each parameter with a validate functions such as Min, Max or Regex bloated my controller. I did not like it and I wanted to move the logic from controller to a single entity just like controller advice.  


## Solution 

As I know the request, I will define the rules based upon my expectations in an XML file. For example,

### 2. Tenant Management
  - Once when an owner adds a property, the property is available for leasing. An owner can add a tenant and lease the property to the tenant according to the capacity at the time of leasing.

  - After adding the tenant, an owner can share a property based on availability.

### 3. Digital Rental Agreement
- The owner has an option to send a digital rental agreement if required. We are using Zoho Sign APIs to create a digital rental agreement and send it to the owner and tenant for e-signature.

 - First, the owner receives the digital rental agreement and the tenant will receive the agreement after the owner e-signs the document.

### 4. Features in pipeline
- Integrate with Stripe for automatic rent payment and send rent receipts periodically.
- Provide a message service with a translator option.
- Move towards stateless authentication with JWT.

 ## Languages and frameworks used
 - Backend - Java 11 and Spring Framework
    - I chose to work with Java as I had prior experience. I wanted to learn a new Java framework and chose the Spring framework as it had many features such as spring-security, controller advice, Dependency Injection.
 - Frontend - Javascript ES6 and AngularJS Framework
     - I chose to work with Javascript as I had prior experience. I was looking for a lightweight framework and also the project is a single page application hence I chose to work with AngularJS
 - Unit testing - JUnit 5
 
 ## Database 
 - Postgres
    - I wanted to work with a database that has good support for indexing so that it could speed up the search query. Postgres had a lot of indexing such as partial, cardinality, GIN. I used GIN for a Full-Text search that avoids full table scan.
    
 ## Build Tool
 - Maven
 
 ## Repository
 - GitHub
  
 ## Devops
 - Jenkins - After finishing the project I wanted to deploy to the AWS server via Jenkins. I learnt Jenkins and built a pipeline script that will auto-deploy to my AWS server.
 - Docker - AWS server had Java version 1.7 but I built my project with Java 11. Even though I hardly used any features of Java 11, I had to make sure my project is compatible with the AWS server. So I created a docker image with Java 11 and pushed the image to the docker hub.
 - AWS - I chose to work with AWS because it had a lot of features and great support. I am using an EC2 instance to run my docker image. Amazon also provides ECR to run docker images but I had to stick with EC2 as it is available in the free tier. I am also using an RDS instance to run a Postgresql server.
